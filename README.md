FlickThru - prediction.io


##Quick Start

 1. [Install the PredictionIO framework](https://docs.prediction.io/install/) **be sure to choose HBase and Elasticsearch** for storage. This template requires Elasticsearch.
 2. Make sure the PIO console and services are running, check with `pio status`
 
###Import Sample Data

1. Create a new app name, change `appName` in `engine.json`
2. Run `pio app new **your-new-app-name**`
3. Import sample events by `./import.sh`
4. The engine.json file in the root directory of your new UR template is set up for the data you just imported (make sure to create a new one for your data). Edit this file and change the `appName` parameter to match what you called the app in step #2
5. The result of the sample queries from `./work/query.sh` are in `./test.out`
